# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project is to show that I wrote JavaScript to help the user make a generated password and also give the user some choices for what they want in their randomized password. 

- What was my motivation? My reasoning for this project was to expierience what it is like to build a website that uses a great amount of Java Script
- Why did I build this project? To understand how Js works.
- What problem does it solve? For people who need a password and can choose what they ant in the password.
- What did I learn? I learned how to be creative with using a basic form of JavaScript. 


## Installation

All you really need is any browser. 

## Features

- 1.) When the page is loaded in you will be able to press the buttion "Generate Password".
- 2.) When that buttion has been hit you will see that it will ask you "How long from 8 to 128 characters would you like to choose?". If you dont pick number it will tell that "Only numbers are allowed". If you try to pick a nunber lower than 8 it will say "Only numbers are allowed". If you try to pick a number above 128 it will say "Password must be less than 129 characters". 
- 3.) After that procces, the browser will provide you with "Would you like your password to include lowercase?" and you as a user can decide if you want to include that feature.
- 4.) After that procces, the browser will provide you with "Would you like your password to include uppercase?" and you as a user can decide if you want to include that feature.
- 5.) After that procces, the browser will provide you with "Would you like your password to include numbers?" and you as a user can decide if you want to include that feature.
- 6.) After that procces, the browser will provide you with "Would you like your password to include special characters?" and you as a user can decide if you want to include that feature.
